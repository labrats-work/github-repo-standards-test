# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant decisions made about the github-repo-standards compliance framework.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. For this repository, we use ADRs to document:

- Compliance framework design decisions
- Automation architecture choices
- Standard definitions and rationale
- Tool selections and integrations
